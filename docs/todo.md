# To-Do

- `const` class method functions
- Create types for objects used throughout project, e.g. make a BoardIndex type for int [0, 63] and a PieceChar type
  - [ ] BoardIndex
  - [x] ChessPiece
  - [x] PieceColor
- Somewhat duplicated logic with check logic, e.g. knight_offsets are copied from piece.cpp
- unit test for `chessPiece_to_char` and `char_to_ChessPiece`
- units tests for `color_to_char` and `char_to_Color`
- switch to camelCase
